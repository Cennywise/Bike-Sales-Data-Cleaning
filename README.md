# Bike Sales Dashboard
This dashboard examines the personal data of bike customers. I did a small amount of cleaning. For example, I spelled out the marital status data. These were abbreviated as M and S, and I changed them to "Married" and "Single" for clarity. I also filtered the customers' ages into 10-year age brackets to make data trends clearer in the dashboard. The original dataset is still included as the bike_buyers sheet in the Excel file.

I created 3 graphs for this dashboard, one for customer income, one for customer age, and one for customer commute distance. Then I included three slicers to allow the user to do further exploration into the data.

Some of the apparent findings were that customers with higher income were more likely to make a purchase. That seems obvious, but it's slightly interesting to confirm. The majority of purchasers were in their 30s, and the most common commute distance of customers was less than 1 mile.
